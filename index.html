        <h1> About Accessibility</h1>
        <p class="para"> Technological devices today have become an extension of our
            individual lives.People with disabilities also use technology extensively and
            in ways similar to other users,but unfortunately the experience is not the same
            for everyone. People with diverse abilities and contexts often
            find themselves excluded from digital products because designers
            overlook their needs and goals. Explore this section further to understand
            what accessibility entails. Further we dive deeper into visual accessibility.

            Accessibility means that the product and its features can be used
            by a wide range of users with different needs. It involves being
            able to adhere to the standard guidelines set by different institutions.
            A group of architects, designers and rehabilitation engineers developed
            a set of guidelines to lay the foundation for Universal Design. This section
            takes you through principles of accessible design and shares sources that can
            be used to help aid your design in the direction of accessibility.

        <p class="para">
            The history of Accessibility in America saw it's first milestone of
            recognition in 1961 with the introduction of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A117.1
            for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities. This standard was the first nationally recognised
            accessible design standard. Every innovation from the design of the typewriter to a game of Mahjong has
            accesibility at the centre of it. This section covers historic milestones and interesting facts about
            design and Accessibility.

        <p class="para">
            We are students of Information Experience Design at Pratt.
            This project is aimed at building a web resource for accessible design.
            We hope it can be a handbook for UX designers to refer to when designing
            for digital experiences. We have focussed specifically on visual accesibility
            through our resources. Explore this section to know more about the project
            and the team.
