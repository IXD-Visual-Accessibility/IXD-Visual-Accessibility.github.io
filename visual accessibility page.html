                <h2>Why Visually Impaired?</h2>
                <p>We decided to look specifically into visually impaired people because globally, at least 2.5 billion
                    people have
                    a near or distance vision impairment, according to a WHO report. It is
                    estimated that there are more than 350 million colorblind people in the world. The prevalence of
                    colorblindness
                    varies, but it is generally agreed that around 8% of males and 0.5% of females are affected by the
                    condition. This means that approximately 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females are colorblind.
                    Approximately 12 children with color deficiency are born per minute. Though WHO
                    pointed out
                    that almost half of the visual impairment cases could have been prevented, population growth and
                    aging
                    mean the
                    risk that more people acquire vision impairment is now bigger than ever. </p>
                <p>Moreover, according to the Global Report on Assistive Technology by WHO and United Nations Children’s
                    Fund, the
                    need for visual impairment technologies was highest among all types of assistive products.
                    Therefore, our project focuses on visual accessibility design.</p>

            <h2>Common Types of Visual Impairment</h2>
            <p>Besides blindness, common types of visual impairment can include low vision and color blindness.</p>

            <h3>Low vision</h3>
            <p>Low vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes, poor acuity (blurry vision), tunnel vision,
                central
                field loss, and clouded vision. The things will not look sharp and clear for people with blurred vision.
                Tunnel
                vision is a vision defect where objects cannot be seen unless they are near the center of the visual
                field.
            </p>
            <h3>Color blindness</h3>

            <p>People who are color blind have trouble seeing the difference between colors, how bright the color
                is,
                and
                different shades of color. Different types of color blindness
                cause
                problems
                seeing different colors.</p>

            <h4>A. Red-green color blindness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Deuteranomaly makes green look more red.</li>



                <li>Protanomaly makes red look more green and less bright. </li>
                <li>Protanopia and deuteranopia both make you unable to tell the difference between red and green at
                    all.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>B. Blue-yellow color blindness</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Tritanomaly makes it hard to tell the difference between blue and green, and between yellow and red.
                </li>
                <li>Tritanopia makes you unable to tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and
                    yellow and
                    pink. It also makes colors look less bright.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>C. Complete color blindness</h4>
            <p>People who acquire complete color blindness can’t see colors at all.</p>
            <div class="hint">
                <p>You can use this <em> color blindness simulator</em> to see how colors appear to people with
                    different types of colorblindness. First, type the color hex code without the pound sign, and then
                    press the Enter key. You can then move their mouse over different buttons to see the corresponding
                    colors.
