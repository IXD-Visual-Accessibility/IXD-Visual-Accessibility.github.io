    <h5>A collection of physical and digital products.</h5>
    </div>
    <p>Historically, accessible products were created for people with special needs but ended up benefitting everyone.
        From a vegetable peeler to a typewriter, people designed innovative solutions to cater to the needs of the
        differently abled. We have created a list of some of these products and categorised them into two different
        sections - Physical Objects and Digital Products.</p>

                <h4>Typewriter</h4>
                <p>Would you believe that the typewriter was invented so that a blind woman could communicate with her
                    lover? This incredible story is behind how the typewriter was invented. Pellegrino Turri developed a
                    typing machine so that his blind lover, Countess Carolina Fantoni, could send him love letters
                    without the need for her to dictate to a scribe. The original machine was not preserved but the
                    letters written by the Countess still survive! You can read more about <a

                <h4>Audiobooks</h4>
                <p>Audiobooks have become a very common way for readers to access their content without looking at a
                    device or reading a book. However, audiobooks have a long history and an interesting origin story.
                    Talking books were one of the first applications of the phonographic when it was invented in
                    1877 — as Thomas Edison said, they could “speak to blind people without effort on their part. The
                    introduction of the cassette made audiobooks much more portable, and the general public began to
                    enjoy the convenience of listening rather than reading. Today, millions of readers enjoy their
                    favorite books through different audiobooks and streaming apps.Source: <a

                <h4>Braille Alphabet Lego Bricks</h4>
                <p>Lego has created a set of 250 bricks with the letters, numbers and symbols of the braille script
                    imprinted on the stangard lego building blocks. These blocks can help blind and visually impared
                    children learn and play at the same time. Though not available workldwide for sale, these bricks
                    will be distributed to selected educational instutions for free. You can read more about it in this

                <h4>TypeCase Keyboard</h4>
                <p>Our increasing reliability of making screens sleek and seamless by removing any tactile buttons from
                    the interface makes them inaccessible to certain groups - specifically those who are blind or have
                    poor motor coordination. Engineer Dougie Mann built the TypeCase keyboard to address this issue. The
                    keyboard is an external attachable phone case and has 5 physical buttons which can be used in
                    different combinations to represent all 26 letters of the alphabet. It brings tactility back into
                    the experience of using a digital device and greatly imrpoves the accessibility of the interface.

                <h4>NaviLens</h4>
                <p>NaviLens does exactly what its title suggests. It helps visually impared people find signage that is
                    otherwise hard to access. NaviLens was developed in Barcelona, Spain to improve the accessibility of
                    the public transport of the city. The app uses unique barcodes that the camera can automatically and
                    accurately scan from a distance of over 20 meters and can inform the users about what that signage
                    says in the real world. The creators of NaviLens hope that this technology will be adopted in
                    different domains to make all spaces accessible. Check out their <a
