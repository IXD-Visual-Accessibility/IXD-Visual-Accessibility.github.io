          <p>The bendy straw was created by Joseph Friedman for his daughter. He saw that she couldn't drink using a
            straight straw and used dental floss and a screw to make a bendy straw. It was first embraced by hospitals
            to serve bed-ridden patients with food</p>

            alt="image of a headphone connected to a phone playing an audiobook">
          <p>The idea of audiobooks was the brainchild of the 'American Foundation of the Blind'. The group recorded
            books on Vinyl records but as technology progressed we saw the coming of things like the Amazon audible
            audio player. Now audiobooks are used by everyone to listen and reduce screen-time.</p>

            <p> Selwyn Goldsmith and a few other architects who were disability advocates were the ones responsible for
              introducing curb cuts. Curb cuts were introduced for wheelchair accessibility but in the long run have
              gone to help people with strollers, suitcases or temporary disabilities like a fracture or injury.</p>

              limited mobility or strength. It was later widely adopted by all kinds of users and is now recommended for
              good dental health since it helps brush with the right technique.</p>

              <p> Sam Farber came up with the OXO grip. The invention was inspired from seeing his wife struggle with
                arthritis. He saw that his wife had difficulty gripping peelers and this led to him coming up with the
                grips for kitchen tools.</p>

                and by medical transcriptionists but now we see much more evolved versions of this technology like voice

                  they were also banned from a few schools for being a distraction.</p>
