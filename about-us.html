        <p>We are first-term Information Experience Design (IXD) students at Pratt and are designing a website concerning accessible design for visually impaired people in this project. We hope it can be a handbook for UX designers to look at when designing.

            <p>Hello! I am a first-year graduate of the Pratt Institute School of Information, where I am pursuing a Master in Information Experience Design (IXD) with a primary focus on user experience (UX). I'm eager to promote learning experiences for youth. I had a career as a K–12 educator before entering the UX field.

            <p>Hi! I am Nishi, a UX Designer currently pursuing my Masters in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute, New York. I am from India and have 3 years of experience working in different design teams. I enjoy reading books, science fiction in particular and love to go on long walks. I seek to design holistic design experiences for people across various backgrounds and cultures.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Technological devices today have become an extension of our individual lives. We use our phones, laptops and other smart devices to complete a variety of everyday tasks. It can be natural to assume that people with disabilities also use technology extensively and in ways similar to regular users. However, this implies that the web experiences designed to be used are accessible to everyone and unfortunately this is not true. People with diverse abilities and contexts often find themselves excluded from digital products because designers overlook their needs and goals. <br> This project focuses on visually impaired people. Besides blindness, common types of visual impairment can include color blindness and low vision. Low vision can include partial sight in one or both eyes, poor acuity (blurry vision), tunnel vision, central field loss, and clouded vision. People with blurred vision face issues with sharpness and clarity. Tunnel vision is a vision defect where objects cannot be seen unless they are near the center of the visual field (“Tunnel Vision”, n.d). Therefore, we as UX designers need to think of UX solutions to address these problems to include the group of visually impaired.We hope that this project serves as a good starting point for designers in their journey towards building visually accessible products.</p>
