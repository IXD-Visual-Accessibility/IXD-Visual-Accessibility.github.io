                <p>Hello! I am a first-year graduate of the Pratt Institute School of Information, where I am pursuing a
                    Master in Information Experience Design (IXD) with a primary focus on user experience (UX). I'm
                    eager to promote learning experiences for youth. I had a career as a K–12 educator before entering
                    the UX field.

                    Masters in Information Experience Design (MsIXD). I have a background in Engineering and have worked
                    as a Product Manager and Founder for the past 9 years. I am here to understand UX in depth and use

                <p>Hi! I am Nishi, a UX Designer currently pursuing my Masters in Information Experience Design at Pratt
                    Institute, New York. I am from India and have 3 years of experience working in different design
                    teams. I enjoy reading books, science fiction in particular and love to go on long walks. I seek to
                    design holistic design experiences for people across various backgrounds and cultures.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Technological devices today have become an extension of our individual lives. We use our phones, laptops and
            other smart devices to complete a variety of everyday tasks. It can be natural to assume that people with
            disabilities also use technology extensively and in ways similar to regular users. However, this implies
            that the web experiences designed to be used are accessible to everyone and unfortunately this is not true.
            People with diverse abilities and contexts often find themselves excluded from digital products because
            designers overlook their needs and goals. <br> This project focuses on visually impaired people. Besides
            blindness, common types of visual impairment can include color blindness and low vision. Low vision can
            include partial sight in one or both eyes, poor acuity (blurry vision), tunnel vision, central field loss,
            and clouded vision. People with blurred vision face issues with sharpness and clarity. Tunnel vision is a
            vision defect where objects cannot be seen unless they are near the center of the visual field (“Tunnel
            Vision”, n.d). Therefore, we as UX designers need to think of UX solutions to address these problems to
            include the group of visually impaired.We hope that this project serves as a good starting point for
            designers in their journey towards building visually accessible products.</p>
