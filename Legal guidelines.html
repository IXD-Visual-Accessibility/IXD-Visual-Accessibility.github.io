                <p>For designers, one of the most important guidelines to look at is The Web Content Accessibility
                    Guidelines (WCAG), a set of international guidelines that help make websites and apps more
                    accessible to
                    individuals with disabilities. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to design and develop
                    websites and apps in a way that makes them easier for people with disabilities to use. By following
                    these guidelines, website and app creators can ensure that their content is accessible to a wider
                    audience, including those with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments.</p>
                <p>This article aims at providing designers a quick walkthrough of WCAG, but you can also find more
                    information in W3Câ€™s website.</p>

            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) were first developed by the World Wide Web Consortium
                (W3C) in 1999 in response to the growing need for web accessibility. The first version of the
                guidelines, known as WCAG 1.0, was published in 1999. This version of the guidelines provided a set of
                principles and guidelines for making web content accessible to people with disabilities, as well as a
                set of checkpoints for evaluating the accessibility of web content. WCAG 2.0 was published in 2008, and
                WCAG 2.1 in 2018.</p>
            <h2>4 Principles</h2>
            <p> There are four principles of accessibility in WCAG. All guidelines are organized according to these
                principles.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="bold_li">Perceivable</li>
                <p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</p>
                <p>One example of how people may perceive content in different ways is a person with color blindness
                    viewing a website or app that uses color to convey information. A person with normal color vision
                    may be able to easily understand the information being conveyed by the use of different colors, but
                    a person with color blindness may not be able to differentiate between certain colors and may miss
                    out on important information. Therefore, the website or app could use other visual indicators, such
                    as patterns or shapes, to convey the same information.
                </p>
                <li class="bold_li">Operable</li>
                <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>
                <p>A person without a physical disability may be able to easily use a keyboard to input text and
                    navigate a website or app, but a person with a physical disability that affects their ability to use
                    a keyboard may not be able to do so.</p>
                <li class="bold_li">Understandable</li>
                <p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
                <p>Content creators need to make sure that the text on their website or app is easy to read and
                    understand for the widest possible audience, including when it is read aloud by text-to-speech
                    technology. This means using clear and simple language, avoiding complex sentence structures, and
                    providing context or explanations for any jargon or specialized terms. By making the text on their
                    website or app accessible to people with visual impairments or other disabilities, content creators
                    can ensure that their content is accessible to a wider audience.</p>
                <li class="bold_li">Robust</li>
                <p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents,
                    including assistive technologies.</p>
                <p>Take a website or app that provides information about public transportation routes and schedules. A
                    sighted person may be able to easily view this information on the website or app, but a person with
                    a visual impairment may need to use a screen reader to access the information. To make the content
                    accessible to people with visual impairments, the website or app must be designed in a way that
                    allows screen reader software to accurately interpret and convey the information about the
                    transportation routes and schedules. This may involve using clear and descriptive headings and
                    labels, providing alt text for images, and properly formatting tables and lists.</p>
            </ol>
            <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
            <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) have three levels of compliance, which reflect the
                priority of support for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The three levels
                are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="bold_li">Level A</li>


                <p>This is the lowest level of compliance, and it focuses on ensuring that the basic accessibility needs
                    of people with disabilities are met. If the content on a website or app is not designed in a way
                    that meets the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), assistive technology
                    may not be able to accurately read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.</p>
                <li class="bold_li">Level AA</li>
                <p>This is the intermediate level of compliance, and it builds on the requirements of Level A by
                    providing additional support for people with disabilities. </p>
                <li class="bold_li">Level AAA</li>
                <p>This is the highest level of compliance, and it provides the most comprehensive support for people
                    with disabilities. This includes meeting all of the requirements of Levels A and AA, as well as
                    additional requirements for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Easy Checks by W3C</h2>
            <p>It is extremely helpful when designers begin to assess the accessibility of a web page. By following
                a few simple steps, designers can quickly determine whether or not accessibility has been addressed
                in even the most basic way on a web page. You can click this link to see the <a
