      <p>Accessibility means how easily and effectively a product or service can be accessed and used. The product and
        its
        features can be used by a wide range of users with different needs. When most people think about accessibility,
        they think about designing for people with disabilities. But that is only partially true. Sarah Horton defines
        disability in an equation:</p>
      <p><em>Ability + Barrier= Disability</em></p>
      <p>According to her, a person's functional capacity
        and the environment we have created are at odds. When websites and applications are poorly designed, barriers
        are
        put in place that prevent users from using the product. As a result, in the social view of disability, it is the
        product rather than the individual who forms the barrier.
      <p>In the efforts to improve the accessbility of products across different domains, a group of architects,
        designers and rehabilitation engineers developed a set of guidelines to lay the foundation for Universal Design
        under the guidance of Ron Mace at North Carolina State University. It outlines 7 basic principles to follow when
        designing accessible products:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Equitable Use</strong><br>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility in Use</strong><br>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and
          abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use</strong><br>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the
          user's
          experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
        <li><strong>Perceptible Information</strong><br>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the
          user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Tolerance for Error</strong><br>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of
          accidental or unintended actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Physical Effort</strong><br>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a
          minimum
          of fatigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use</strong><br>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach,
          reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
      </ol>
