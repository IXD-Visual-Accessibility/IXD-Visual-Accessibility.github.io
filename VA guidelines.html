            <p>Here are some basic accessibility rules to remember when designing.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="bold_li">Use HTML markup and create a clear content hierarchy</li>

                <p>Using semantic HTML5 markup is crucial for ensuring that a web page's content and structure are
                    accurately
                    conveyed to screen readers. While JavaScript and CSS styling may be used to enhance the
                    appearance
                    of a
                    page, these elements are ignored by screen readers, so it's important to rely on default HTML
                    tags
                    and
                    headings to ensure that the page is accessible. When inspecting a web page, you may notice that
                    certain
                    tags, such as
                    &#60;p&#62;,

                    &#60;body&#62;, &#60;header&#62;, &#60;nav&#62;, and &#60;footer&#62;, are used to organize the
                    content.
                    Using these tags correctly is
                    important, as it allows screen readers to properly interpret the page's structure.

                </div>
                <p>Headings are also an important element of accessible web design. There are six levels of
                    headings,
                    from H1 to
                    H6, and these should be used to indicate the hierarchy of content on the page. The H1 tag should
                    be
                    used for
                    the main page title, and subsequent headings should be used to indicate sub-topics and
                    sub-sections
                    within
                    the page. It's important to be consistent with heading levels, so that screen readers can
                    accurately
                    interpret the page's content.</p>
                <div class="intext_img"><img src="Media/heading.png" alt="heading hierarchy">
                </div>
                <li class="bold_li">Provide alternative texts</li>
                <p>It's important to provide text-based alternatives for any visual content on a web page, such as
                    images and
                    videos. This allows users with screen readers to access the information on the page and
                    understand
                    its
                    content. If there is missing alt text for an image, the screen reader will read the image's URL,
                    which can
                    confuse and frustrate users. Therefore, it's important to ensure that all visual content has
                    appropriate alt
                    text.</p>
                <div class="intext_img"><img src="Media/alt.png"
                        alt="coding image with alt texts versus without alt texts"></div>

                <p>It's also essential to ensure that text is easily readable and accessible. This means allowing
                    users
                    to
                    adjust the font size to make it easier to read, and providing the option to convert text into
                    other
                    formats,
                    such as braille (a tactile writing system used by visually impaired people).</p>

                <li class="bold_li">Choose colors carefully</li>
                <p>Using contrast and hues of the same color. Contrast is a great friend for perception for impaired
                    vision of
                    all kinds and enhances readability. Always remember to check what the design looks like for
                    visually
                    impaired people first. You can use tools such as color blindness simulators to examine if there
                    are
                    any
                    changes to be made.</p>
                <p><a href="resources.html">Click here to see the tools that we recommend.</a> </p>
                <p>Don’t refer to color only when giving instructions, especially for clear error and state change..
                    “Click the
                    red button” isn’t helpful to a color-blind person. “Click the rectangle button” is. This ensures
                    lesser
                    dependency on visual perception of color to understand if for example a wrong input has been
                    made.
                </p>
                <p> Use shapes and colors to distinguish different elements. This ensures that even those with
                    color-blindness
                    can perceive different elements of the interface well.</p>
                <li class="bold_li">Pay attention to font Size and weights</li>
                <p>Many modern design fonts are clean and thin, but these fonts can be difficult for people with
                    visual
                    impairments to read. To ensure that your text is accessible, it's important to use a font size
                    of at
                    least
                    12 pt. Text that is smaller than this can be difficult for anyone to read, and it can be
                    especially
                    challenging for people with visual impairments. Additionally, it's important to avoid using
                    colors
                    that are
                    hard to distinguish, such as red and green, which can be difficult for people with color
                    blindness
                    to
                    differentiate. By considering these factors, you can ensure that your website is accessible to a
                    wider range
                    of users.</p>
                <p>Center the content and bigger text size. This helps focus on the central elements especially for
                    those with
                    tunnel vision and ensures that main elements of a website don’t lose its significance or
                    essence.
